# Capital-One-Spend-Prediction-Uncovering-Customer-Behaviour-with-Machine-Learning

This repository houses the code and insights from a machine learning project aimed at predicting the total spend of Capital One credit facility customers and understanding the key factors influencing their spending. We built a model that analyzes customer data to forecast future financial activity and unveil hidden patterns in customer behaviour.

## Project Objectives:

Predict total customer spend: Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately forecasting the overall expenditure of Capital One credit facility customers.
Identify spend influencers: Uncover the features that have the most significant impact on customer spending patterns.
Gain actionable insights: Leverage the model's predictions and feature influence analysis to understand customer behaviour and inform data-driven marketing strategies.

## Key Findings:

The model successfully predicted customer spend with high accuracy using various machine learning algorithms.
Feature analysis revealed significant influence of factors like:
Age: Older customers tended to spend more compared to younger customers.
Parent status: Having children was associated with increased spending.
Mobile app usage: Active mobile app users exhibited higher spending compared to non-users.
Other insightful features included income level, credit limit, purchase history, and transaction time of day.
